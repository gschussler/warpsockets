- ADD
  - '${user} joined the lobby.' / '${user} left the lobby' as text in the Lobby messaging.
  - non-annoying sound when a message is sent/received

- FIX
  - usage of dotenv for external ip in the socket connection from the frontend (possibly find solution not dotenv?)
  - temporarily hardcoded (DO NOT COMMIT WHEN IP IS HARD CODED)
  - mobile UI (honestly the UI in general as well lol)

- REFACTOR
  - A WebSocket connection should only be instantiated when a user enters a lobby, not upon coming to the site itself
