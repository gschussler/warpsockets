# warpsockets
_Real-time, ephemeral chatrooms powered by Go, WebSocket, and React_

Chatting with sub-millisecond latency should be what all communication platforms strive for where possible.
Try warpsockets out, see how fast communication can be.
- Chat with whoever, just enter the same lobby!
- When no one is left in a lobby, its messages are deleted permanently.

Give it a try! Just head to **[warpsockets.xyz](https://warpsockets.xyz)**
